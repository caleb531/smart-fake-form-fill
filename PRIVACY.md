# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Smart Fake Form Fill ("the Extension") is an AI-powered Chrome extension
designed to assist developers by generating fake data for form-filling and
testing. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your data when
you use our Extension.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 14th, 2025.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension sends the HTML of the chosen form to the OpenAI API to generate
the fake data. These API calls are encrypted in transit with HTTPS, and are only
sent when you trigger the extension via the "Smart Fake Form Fill" item in the
right-click menu. Please see [OpenAI's privacy policy][openai-privacy-policy]
for how they collect and manage the data they receive from the Extension.

# API Key

The Extension requires an OpenAI API key to function. This API key is stored
locally and never leaves your device, nor is it synced between browser
installations.

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for how they use the generated data. The Extension is
intended for testing and non-malicious purposes only.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected
in the Extension's description and on our [GitHub repository][github].
