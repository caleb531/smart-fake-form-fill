# Smart Fake Form Fill

Smart Fake Form Fill is a Chrome extension for populating forms with relevant,
AI-generated data. This is different from other fake data form-filling
extensions, which require you to specify field types, and which don't understand
the semantics of the fields they are populating.

Rather, this extension will send all form metadata (labels, formats, etc.) to
the LLM so it can produce more realistic fake data (as counterintuitive as that
sounds).
